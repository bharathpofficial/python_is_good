You just need 'report' file [case sensitive] with actuall nmap Report.

usage:
-------------------
getmeports report |
-------------------
wait for the Magic...

this is a basic script, that will just give you info about ports, thats the name 'getmeports', 

improvement would be to get a nice clean REPORT for each and every IP_ADDR

IP_ADDR

<ports section>

--------------------------

<nmap -A section>
